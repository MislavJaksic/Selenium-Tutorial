## [On test automation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/introduction/on_test_automation/)

Try unit tests or mocking before web browser testing.  
Setup a test by:
* creating data
* performing actions
* evaluating results

Be careful of race conditions. Solve them with proper code.  

Test must be:
* small
* written from the user's perspective

Only test stable parts of the codebase.
